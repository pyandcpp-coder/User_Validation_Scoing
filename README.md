2) per day max likes to take into account is 5 and same with comments 5 only. 


## Task 

1) Duplicate Content Detection
2) Avoid Giberrish content
3) avoid rewriting and plagarism -- creation of vector db or some



## Constants

1) Per user will be graded between 0 to 100 points not more than that strict rule
2) Above conditions are true for eg 5 likes 5 comments 2 post there are only to be considered 


## Idea of the project

Based on the score the user will be given tokes (money) and out ai should intelligently analize the whole features and give points as output,

--> chekcing for plagarism form the vector db or any efficient data storage
--> check for other checks 
--> if passed then working on scoring
